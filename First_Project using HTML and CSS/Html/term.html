        </h1>
        <p>Welcome to our website. Please carefully read our terms and conditions. If you continue to browse and use
            this website you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions: </p>
        <h3>Booking Procedure</h3>
        <p>Car rental booking is now made easier with our new reservation system, providing real-time availability
            information, online payment and instant confirmation.
            1/ Check availability - select Pick-Up Date & Location, Return Date & Location, enter your age, and you will
            see a list of available vehicles and prices.
            2/ Select the vehicle of your choice. Press the “Book Now” button.
            3/ Choose rental options (if any), add discount coupon (if applicable), fill in driver details. Check the
            box, confirming that you have read the Terms and Conditions and then press “Confirm Booking”. A summary of
            your booking with payment details will appear. Please review the details and if all is in order, press
            “Confirm Booking”.</p>
        <p>4/ Complete the payment information. The system navigates to a ‘Thank you’ page and sends you an automatic
            email listing all the services you booked. Your booking is confirmed and the vehicle is reserved if payment
            has been completed successfully. Important note: Reservations without completed payment are still processed
            but considered pending. Within 12 hours of receipt of the pending reservation we will contact you to clarify
            details and payment options. Please note, however, for unpaid reservations type of vehicle and price may
            change subject to availability. </p>
        <h2>Genral Conditions</h2>
        <p>The car rental is subject to the terms of the Car Rental Agreement executed between the Renter and
            Renaissance Rent a Car at the time of the car pick-up. </p>
        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>Pricing is quoted on a ‘per day’ basis (24 hour period). Our inclusive rates include collision damage waiver
            (CDW), fire and theft waiver (FTW), third party liability (TPL), road tax, unlimited mileage, additional
            driver, VAT</p>
        <h2>Vechicle condition</h2>
        <p>The vehicle must be returned to the drop-off location specified in the contract in the same condition as when
            it was picked up by the renter. It is the responsibility of the renter to ensure that the vehicle is
            thoroughly checked prior to picking up the vehicle. The client accepts responsibility for taking due care
            and attention of the vehicle. Failure to do so and loss or damage to the interior and exterior of the
            vehicle is deemed negligent and responsible for the charges as listed in the damage matrix. Whilst in charge
            of the vehicle the client accepts responsibility for maintaining the roadworthiness of the vehicle and
            agrees to take remedial action to avoid unnecessary cost/damage. This will include maintaining oil levels,
            tire pressures and other common sense actions to maintain the vehicle. Should a cost is involved, the
            required action needs to be communicated with the rental company.</p>
        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>Cancellation of your reservation should be made by email or text/viber/whatsapp message at least 48 hours
            prior to the start of your rental. Please note that telephone cancellations will not be accepted.</p>
        <h2>Cancellation charges</h2>
        <p>There are no cancellation charges for bookings cancelled up to 48 hours prior to rental. For bookings
            cancelled less than 48 hours of rental, the cost of 1 day rental is due.</p>
        <h2>Presonal and Driving Requirements</h2>
        <p>The required minimum age to rent a vehicle is 25 years for SUV vehicles, and 21 years for all other vehicles.
            Customers must present at the time of rental: a valid driving license, issued at least 2 years prior to the
            day of rental, passport, and a credit card. Personal and driving requirements apply to all additional
            drivers.</p>
        <h2>Payment Method</h2>
        <p>We accept payment by cash, bank transfer, credit or debit cards. We accept all major credit and debit cards
            (Visa and Mastercard). American Express and Diners are not accepted.</p>
        <h2>BreakDown/Accident</h2>
        <p>In the event of a breakdown or accident, the driver must contact Renaissance Rent A Car immediately for
            instructions and assistance. It is highly recommended to call the police even for the smallest of damages. A
            protocol from the police, car documents and keys must be presented for the insurance to be activated. If the
            driver fails to act accordingly, s/he may be charged for all damages incurred as a result. If an accident is
            caused by a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or in any other circumstances in which the
            insurance coverage is excluded, the driver shall be responsible for all the damages incurred to the car
            rental company.</p>
        <h2>Fuel</h2>
        <p> We operate “full-to-full” fuel policy, which means that all cars are delivered with full tank of fuel and
            must be returned with a full tank of fuel from a petrol station no more than 10 km from the car rental
            branch. Proof (receipt) is required when the car is returned. If the car tank is not full, a refueling
            charge of 15 EUR applies in addition to the cost of the missing fuel.</p>
        <h2>Unlimited Millage</h2>
        <p>Unlimited mileage is included in the rates for all cars.</p>
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Renaissance Rent A Car treats all information collected on this website as confidential. We respect and take
            the privacy of our customers very seriously. The information we collect may be used to complete and
            administer the car rental booking. We may also use this information to compile a broad profile of visitors
            who access and book via the website. Please note that all information is aggregated, therefore no
